Allows you to test hashextension (extending an existing hash).

This is meant to prove that signatures on the form Hash(secret + data to sign) are vulnerable.

Most notably this was a problem for Flickr a while back because they used
MD5(API_KEY + parameters)

You need bouncycastle to use this
Tested with bcprov-jdk16-146.jar

Oh, and don't use hash(secret + data). Use HMAC instead.
